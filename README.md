# 🧹 Kaltura User Cleanup (Manual Deprovisioning via CSV)

Kaltura's KMS and KMC systems do **not** currently support SCIM for automated user provisioning or deprovisioning.  
This guide outlines a workaround using exported CSV files to identify and bulk-remove inactive or exited users.

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Deprovisioning Workflow

### 1. Export List of Active Users
Export a current list of active users from one of the following systems:
- Microsoft Active Directory
- Workday
- ADP

> This list will serve as your **source of truth** for active employees.

---

### 2. Export All Kaltura Users
Log in to **KMC**, go to **Users** and use the **Export** functionality to download a complete list of Kaltura users.

---

### 3. Compare and Filter
Using Excel or a script:
- Cross-reference the exported lists.
- Identify users who:
  - Are **not present** in the active employee list.
  - Are no longer with the company.
- Confirm these users are safe to delete (coordinate with HR or team leads as needed).

### 4. Create the Deletion CSV File

#### 📁 CSV Format:

| action | userID              |
|--------|---------------------|
| 3      | johndoe@null.com    |

- `action` column: enter `3` to mark user for deletion
- `userID` column: enter the user's Kaltura login (usually their email)
- Name your file something like:  
  `bulk-user-deactivation.csv`

> 🧠 **Best Practice:** Limit the list to **100 users per upload** for faster processing.

---

### 5. Upload the CSV to Kaltura

#### In the KMS Portal:
1. Navigate to **Manage Users**
2. Locate the **Bulk Upload** section
3. Upload your `bulk-user-deactivation.csv` file

#### In the KMC Portal:
1. Go to the **Upload Logs** section
2. Click **Bulk Upload** → check the **status** of your submission
3. Confirm processing and validate that users were removed
